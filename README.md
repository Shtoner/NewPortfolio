I utilized Parallax.JS for this site and made it so all the contents in the page would move and react to your mouse movement along with a canvas element portraying a stalemate of Pong and links to other sites.
I chose Parallax.Js for the html effect.
I utilized Three.Js for the background using their particle system.
I bundled this with Webpack.
